I've decided to rewrite my first ever iPhone app (Yet Another Pomodoro Timer - [YAPT](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/yapt-yet-another-pomodoro/id926057573?mt=8 "iTunes Store")) in Swift. While in Shanghai earlier this year I worked my way through Apple's [Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html "About Swift") introduction and there were a couple of things I felt were worth of exploring further.

 - Enumerations with Associated Values
 - Optionals and Optional Chaining

When reading the documentation these seem to make sense, but without a practical problem to solve, I often find some topics difficult to grasp. Hence the re-write of YAPT.

I intend to write more about my journey with the language but, as with the original version of the app, the code is all available on GitHub: [billglover/YAPT_Swift](https://github.com/billglover/YAPT_Swift/tree/develop "YAPT_Swift development branch").
