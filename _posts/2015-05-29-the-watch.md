I managed to make it through a couple of weeks with the Apple Watch before someone asked me what I thought of it. For a piece of technology that has been touted as a fashion accessory, something to be worn and shown off, it is remarkably understated. This is a good thing and exactly what I hoped it would be; discrete, unobtrusive, and personal. I love it.

One feature above everything else makes the watch a genuine delight to wear: The [Taptic Engine](https://www.apple.com/watch/technology/#human-touch "Appleâ€™s Taptic Engine"). The ability to receive discrete feedback without disturbing others is something I've never managed to achieve with a phone.

### A genuinely silent phone

For as long as I can remember I have had my phone permanently on silent. I regularly leave my phone on the desk and cannot stand the noise it makes as it vibrates across a hard surface and so silent for me means no sound and no vibration. The only trouble with this is that I'd never notice incoming calls. The end result: I ended up missing more calls than I felt was polite.

As an experiment, I used a little known accessibility feature to flash the camera LED as an alternative to an audible notification but more than once this put me in an awkward situation when this notification was mistaken for a photo. The visible notifications didn't last long at all.

The Taptic Engine in the watch allows for notifications without disturbing anyone else; no scrambling to silence a ring tone, no rumbling desk. The tap on the wrist is so discrete that it is possible to ignore it if the situation warrants it. As a result, I've re-enabled some notifications, started to answer calls and respond to messages promptly all without disturbing those around me. For someone as self-conscious as myself who feels incredibly awkward if my phone makes even so much as a sound, the Taptic Engine is an absolute godsend.

> **Tip:** Disable all notifications, yes all of them. Then go back and enable the ones you feel you need. Your experience of the watch will be all the better for it.

### Stand! - the constant nagging

It turns out I get a remarkable degree of exercise for someone who spends the majority of their time at work sat at a desk. With an average of 10k steps/day for the last year you could argue I'm [living healthy](http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/getting-started-guides/pages/getting-started-walking.aspx "NHS: Walking for Health"), but steps is only one measure of activity. I need to do more. The doctor has said so, and now the watch says so. The double tap to indicate that I'm approaching an hour without standing has me stepping away from the keyboard and walking around the office a little. In the short period I've had the watch I've noticed that I'm doing this more without having to be notified. The break from the screen is just as beneficial as the brief activity.

I've worn a [FitBit One](https://www.fitbit.com/uk/one "Fitbit One") for a couple of years now. Two years in, I still wear it and still look at the data. But, despite there being a display on the device, I find myself looking at the data retrospectively. If it gets to 10pm and I've only hit half my steps target for the day then there isn't much I'm going to do about it. [Casey Liss](http://www.caseyliss.com) summed this up with this tweet.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-cards="hidden" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, YOU just walked around your neighborhood in the dark like a creeper to reach your exercise goal. <a href="http://t.co/JREY10ZhqA">pic.twitter.com/JREY10ZhqA</a></p>&mdash; Casey Liss (@caseyliss) <a href="https://twitter.com/caseyliss/status/596851770829250560">May 9, 2015</a></blockquote>

Where the watch excels is in providing feedback before it's too late to take action. The real-time feedback provided by the activity rings on the watch face is subtle but invaluable. The similarities between the circular watch face and the circular activity rings allow for a subconscious comparison between where you are and where you need to be against your activity target. Take a break and go for a walk, before you end up walking around the neighbourhood like a creeper.

That said, there are a couple of oddities with the fitness tracking capabilities of the watch:

 - There is no option to use Metric units everywhere
 - Lacking full integration with [HealthKit](https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/health/ "Apple HealthKit") (more on HealthKit in a future post)
 - A lack of synergy between the '[Move](https://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/#move "Apple Watch: 'Move'")', '[Stand](https://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/#stand "Apple Watch: 'Stand'")', and '[Exercise](https://www.apple.com/watch/health-and-fitness/#exercise "Apple Watch: 'Exercise'")' goals (I seem to be able to complete the exercise target whilst only burning a few calories)

These issues aside (it's a version 1.0 1), the constant but discrete nagging from the Activity tracker highlights the potential of the watch as an assistant for habit forming. As the development landscape matures I expect to see more developers try to take advantage of this.

> **Tip:** The watch won't form habits for you. You need a certain element of self discipline. It can discretely remind you to stand up, but it won't force you to do so.

### Siri Speaks Multiple Languages (but not at the same time)

There have been a couple of moments where the Watch has surprised me. The most notable being the language detection in the Messages App.

My wife and I occasionally message each other in Chinese. The exchanges don't last long as inevitably the conversation progresses beyond the limits of my Mandarin. But amazingly Siri keeps up. If I reply on the Watch during one of these Chinese exchange, Siri recognises we have switched languages, and accepts dictation in Chinese instead of English. This contextual awareness is incredible for just how natural it feels.

Siri may be multi-lingual, but she does need a little work to remove certain points of friction in the experience. The lack of a truly hands-free mode for Siri that feels like a sticking point in the experience. Everything you say still requires a physical tap to confirm the interaction.

## The Future

Perhaps the most exciting thing about any new platform is the potential it holds for developers and the Watch is no exception. The initial rush to port iPhone apps to the Watch will die down as developers start to understand the way we interact with the Watch. I expect to see more developers following the lead of Marco Arment ([Redesigning Overcast's Apple Watchapp](http://www.marco.org/2015/05/08/overcast-apple-watch-redesign)) and re-thinking the focus of their Watch apps. It isn't just an iPhone with a smaller screen.

As for me, well I'll leave you with this little teaser as to what I've been working on.
