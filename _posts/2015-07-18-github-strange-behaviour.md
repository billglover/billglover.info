So what does GitHub want with Vogue and GQ?

I can't think of any reason that GitHub's Mac App would need to connect to either Vogue or GQ. These requests (and more) appear in the build 194 of the App which has a codename (Honourary Brit) which would explain the `.co.uk` version of these sites. In the latest build (208) these requests seem to have been removed.
