AutoHotKey is one of those utilities that is so good you forget you are using it. If you find yourself doing the same thing more than a couple of times each day and [AutoHotKey](http://ahkscript.org) can probably step in to help you out. Consider it macros on steroids.

Here are the scripts I use most regularly.

## Application Shortcuts

Here I make use of the (otherwise useless) [menu key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key) found on most office keyboards.

 - `Menu Key + v` to paste as plain text
 - `Menu Key + c` to launch a terminal
 - `Menu Key + e` to start a text editor

## Spotify Shortcuts

Spotify seem to have removed access to their in-app controls so things like favouriting a song are out, but for keyboards without media keys, the following are essential.
