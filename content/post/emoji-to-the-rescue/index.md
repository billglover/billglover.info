During lockdown I've been learning to write Chinese characters. I've been making slow but consistent progress. More importanly, I've been enjoying it again. Some characters are definitely easier to recall than others. As it turns out, emoji can be a great way to represent the stories I've used to get some of the characters to stick.

### 秋： 🌾 🔥

> Think of the farmer who spends “autumn” throwing left over *rice* on the *fire* to burn it before it rots during winter.

### 愁： 🍂 ❤️ 

> As *autumn* comes to an end your *heart* becomes “gloomy” as you only have winter to look forward to.

### 利： 🌾 🗡

> If you want to make a “profit”, you’d better guard every single grain of *rice* with a *sword*.

### 揪： 🤚 🍂

> Use your *fingers* to “hold on tight” to the last few days of *autumn*. It only gets colder from here on in.

### 香： 🌾 ☀️

> Think of those bags of jasmine *rice* with the silhouette of the farmer in the logo of the shining *sun*. Jasmine rice is of course the most “fragrant” of all rice.
